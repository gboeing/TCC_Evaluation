# TCC_Evaluation

This repository archives code developed by the [UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation](https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/)(and collaborators) to evaluate the impacts of California’s [Transformative Climate Communities Program (TCC)](http://sgc.ca.gov/programs/tcc/) on awarded sites. Authorized by Assembly Bill 2722 in 2016, TCC funds the development and implementation of neighborhood-level transformative plans that include multiple projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to fighting climate change, the program empowers disadvantaged communities impacted by poverty and pollution to design projects that achieve their local economic, environmental, and health goals.

The [California Strategic Growth Council (SGC)](http://sgc.ca.gov/) serves as the lead administrator of TCC. SGC awarded the first round of TCC grants to the following three sites: (1) the City of Fresno ($66.5 million for their [Transform Fresno](http://www.transformfresno.com/) proposal); (2) the City of Ontario ($33.25 million for their [Ontario Together](http://www.ontariotogether.com/) proposal); and (3) the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles ($33.25 million for their [Watts Rising](https://twitter.com/wattsrising) proposal).

TCC includes mechanisms for accountability, including oversight from community members and third-party evaluation from academic researchers. Researchers at the [UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation](https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/) and the [UC Berkeley Center for Resource Efficient Communities](https://crec.berkeley.edu/) comprise the evaluation team for Round 1 of TCC grants. UCLA researchers will also take on a fourth TCC site for evaluation – Northeast Valley Los Angeles – during Round 2 of TCC implementation. To learn more about the scope of TCC evaluation efforts, access preliminary deliverables, and get in touch with associated research staff, visit the [TCC evaluation resource page](https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/tracking-groundbreaking-climate-action/) hosted by the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. 

Researchers are encouraged to use the code posted here to conduct their own analyses of neighborhood transformation, and to monitor the effects of TCC investments long after the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation has funding to do so.
